# Flick_Finder_Group_Project
This is a group project I worked on with four others as part of our final assignment for the CFG JavaScript Kickstarter.

The theme of our project was culture. After much deliberation, the team decided on a movie picker website.

We wanted to incorporate several functions; filtering the type of movie you want to watch based on genre, release date and running time. We used an array of objects to store each movies information into our database; if we had had more time, we would've liked to incorporate an API for cleaner code.

We also added a randomiser function to suggest a movie.

We added a 'save to list' function so we could create a watch later list, which we would've like to make shareable but again we ran out of time.

Finally, we added a catalogue of our movies at the bottom of the website which flips between the movie image and the description on the back.

Basic funstions were incorporated such as a nav bar and footer. Unfortunately we had to code this project in Codepen as specified by the course so the navigation is fairly basic; taking us to seperate divs in the HTML rather than seperate pages within the website.
